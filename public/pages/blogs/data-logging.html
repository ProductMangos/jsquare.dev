    <p>We programmers tend to focus all our efforts in building the application and when it's finally complete, we ship it out to the world. Unfortuntely in our drive to push out the application, we tend to place our logging on the backburner. When bugs appear, we'll always wish we had it in place.</p>
    <h3 style="margin: 20px 0; font-style: italic">What does it mean to log?</h3>
    <p>The action of storing data to be referenced outside of the application is logging. The actual data to be stored can be anything from:
        <ul style="margin-left: 2rem">
            <li>Trace</li>
            <li>Debug</li>
            <li>Warnings</li>
            <li>Errors</li>
            <li>Fatals</li>
            <li>Misc. Console Logs</li>
            <li>Etc..</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
