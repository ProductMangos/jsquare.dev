<h2>Why a website and this design?</h2>

    <p>As I continue to develop my skills and knowledge in the field of software development, I have come to realize that I am absolutely terrible at remembering what I've done what to a certain point. My weakness when it comes to development is my lack of motivation and organization to document the things I've tried and/or completed.</p>
    <p>I'm hoping to use this website to provide a platform for me to share my thoughts and ideas on various topics and, since this is my personal website that I'm actually going to share with others, I have a belief that this may (or not) keep me accountable.</p>
    <h3 style="margin: 20px 0; font-style: italic">Why this design?</h3>
    <p>I am not a very creative designer when it comes to the appearance of websites so I like to take a lot of inspiration from other existing websites. One website in particular I took much inspiration from: <a href="https://cassidoo.co/">Cassidy Williams</a></p>

    <p>I really enjoy her minimalistic design without the need to go over the top with CSS splashes and animations. I like to keep things simple and clean and her website is a great example of that. I took what I considered the main points of the website and applied them to my own website without the wide various of separate and uniquely changing colors. </p>
    <p>One other key difference between our websites is also how it's built, which probably describes me best... I wanted to create a website with a known design but do it myself differently than the original. This website was create with just HTML, CSS and vanilla JS using AJAX oppose to using a framework.</p>

    <p>For those that would actually read these blogs from my very minimal website, I hope you enjoy it and find it useful. Cheers.</p>
