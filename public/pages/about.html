    Hey, I'm Jordan Cuadrado, a software developer, mechanical engineer and a dad
    from Harrisburg, PA.
</p>
<p>
    I'm currently working as a Software Developer II at PSECU with hopes to
    continue to learn and explore new technologies. Outside of work, I like to
    build useless applications, learn new programming concepts with attempts to
    document it and look for opportunities to try new things with my family.

    Feel free to check out my blog and github for my latest work and projects!
